                            <p>Owning a plant is not only a financial investment,
                                but an emotional investment as well. People get very attached to their plants
                                which can lead to a traumatic experience when they die.
                                Many individuals express interest in owning houseplants, but they lack the knowledge,
                                guidance, or structure required to ensure proper care of the plants.
                                In addition, worries of plants that are toxic to pets discourages inexperienced plant
                                owners
                                from having both plants and pets. </p>

                                demographic information, and helped shape the direction of the interview. The interviews
                                were conducted over Zoom to utilize the automatic transcription feature. A total of 11
                                participants interviews were conducted. Each interview lasted between 20-40 minutes. At

                                    taking care of the plants he received as gifts. Later, he got more enthusiastic
                                    about
                                    plants,
                                    and bought more indoor plants which are easy to take care of. He gets frustrated

                                    forgets

                                    needs to buy for his existing plants as well as his new plants.

                                The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) assures safe and healthful
                                working conditions by setting and enforcing standards, and by providing training,
                                outreach, education, and assistance. OSHA Form 300, “Log of Work-Related Injuries and
                                Illnesses” is used to classify work-related injuries and illnesses and to note the
                                extent and severity of each case. When an incident occurs, use the Log to record
                                specific details about what happened and how it happened. OSHA Form 301, “Injury and
                                Illness Incident Report,” is used by employers to keep a record of a single injury,
                                illness, or death in a workplace. This form is found within OSHA Form 300, which is used
                                to log and classify all such incidents for a workplace. Each incident recorded on OSHA
                                Form 300 must also be documented in greater detail on OSHA Form 301.</p>

                                staff directly involved in or observing adverse events, such as nurse managers,
                                front-line nurses, pharmacists, and physicians. According to The Joint Commis­sion in
                                the United States, nurses submit the highest number of incident reports. These
                                individuals typically submit the majority of incident reports, as they are firsthand
                                witnesses to incidents. However, an effective incident reporting system should allow
                                anyone, including staff, patients, families, or visitors, to report incidents. </p>

                                    <p>Harmful incidents involve injury or illness to a patient or another
                                        individual. For example, a patient could fall out of bed and break their arm or
                                        scratch a nurse as she takes their temperature.

                                        almost harmed, but the situation was corrected before it occurred. For example,
                                        a patient might get caught trying to leave the facility prematurely or trip, but
                                        a nurse catches them before they fall.

                                    <p>A no-harm incident means that something happened to a patient or another person,

                                        no discernible injury or illness resulted. For example, a patient could be given

                                        blood transfusion meant for another patient, but no harm was done because the

                                        was compatible.

                                Designing web-based interfaces for incident reporting systems, it's essential to
                                prioritize simplicity and ease of use. It's important to keep the process of reporting
                                incidents is simple and straightforward. We need to make the reporting process clear,
                                using intuitive language and step-by-step instructions. Then we need to organize the
                                interface logically, with buttons and menus, and maintain consistency in design elements
                                like colors and fonts. It is important to provide helpful documentation to guide users
                                through the process, and also the interface has to be responsive. </p>

                                <li>Visualizations such as charts and graphs can help users easily understand trends and

                                <li>Data visualizations can provide insights about incident locations and source easily
                                    which would help administrators to identify key resources.</li>
                                <li>Trend analysis also can help predict potential incident risk and guide preventive

                        elements which covers user interaction, focusing on the ease of use, submitting incident
                        records, and accuracy for reviewing report and appending case documentation, input form and

                                much closer and try to give space between incons and feature so that users can easily
                                tap or
                                navigate.

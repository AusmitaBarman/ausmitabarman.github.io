                            <p>The coronavirus pandemic caused a severe impact on the aviation industry throughout 2020,
                                leading to an enormous reduction in revenue streams of air carriers that couldn't cover
                                the costs of operating. The pandemic's effect has continued into 2021, with airlines
                                struggling to cope with the Covid 19 situation. This project aims to conduct a visual
                                analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on the domestic airline industry and its recovery
                                progress.

                                    industry</h3>
                                <p>As we can see from the chart, because of the pandemic the air transport system
                                    virtually came to a halt. With strict travel restrictions and quarantine
                                    requirements, passengers became less interested in air travel. Airline revenue
                                    streams were immensely low, and the damage to the airline industry was devastating.

                                    The year 2020 marked the worst financial year for domestic airlines in the last 12
                                    years, with a net income of -30M which is 288 percent drop from 2019 net income.
                                    However, the industry has shown signs of improvement in 2021 and 2022, with net
                                    incomes of 1.16M and 1.63M, respectively. Yet, the data indicates that the sector is
                                    still falling short of its financial performance in 2019. These findings highlight
                                    the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the domestic airline industry and
                                    the need for continued efforts to recover from the financial fallout.

                                    those with fewer employees are represented by smaller bubbles. We can quickly and
                                    simply compare the staff sizes of US domestic airlines using this visualization.

                                    fluctuations in their net income and profit loss over the years. However, Delta
                                    Airlines and United Airlines followed almost similar trend in their net income and
                                    profit loss, whereas Southwest Airlines had a little more stable pattern until 2019.
                                    All three airlines experienced a significant decline in net income and profit in

                                    had the greatest net income in most years and suffered the most in 2020. However, in
                                    terms of profit loss, United Airlines had the highest loss in 2020, followed by
                                    Delta and Southwest.

                                    The first plot provides a year-over-year comparison, indicating an overall upward
                                    trend in the industry's demand. However, the second plot, which compares demand
                                    against 2019, helps us understand the impact of the pandemic and the industry's
                                    recovery. From the first plot we see from 2020 to 2021 demand increased by 88
                                    percent, but second plot depict the whole story. In 2021 demand is still 24 percent
                                    below compare to pre pandemic. Despite the pandemic's impact, the data reveals the
                                    industry is returning to pre pandemic level in 2023.

                                    Comparing domestic air industry capacity using available seat miles (ASM) and
                                    passenger capacity data from 2011 to 2022 can provide valuable insights into the
                                    industry's growth and resilience. By examining year-over-year comparisons in the
                                    first plot, we can observe patterns and trends in the industry's capacity. The
                                    second plot focuses on the industry's recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic by
                                    comparing against 2019, the last year before the pandemic. This comparison enables
                                    us to understand how quickly the industry is recovering and whether it has fully
                                    regained its pre-pandemic capacity. Overall, such analyses can help stakeholders in
                                    the air industry make informed decisions and plan for the future.

                                    Orlando International Airport (MCO) is one of the busiest airports in the United
                                    States, serving millions of passengers every year. The pandemic has had a
                                    significant effect on the aviation industry, and MCO was no exception. In this
                                    section, to investigate Orlando International Airport's (MCO) performance and
                                    recovery from covid, will analyze the passenger traffic, flight numbers, and revenue
                                    passenger miles at MCO from 2011 to 2022.

                                    trend in both domestic and international flights over the years. In 2011, the
                                    domestic passenger count was approximately 16 million, and it increased to 22
                                    million in 2022. Similarly, the international passenger count rose from 1.6 million
                                    to almost 2 million during the same period.</p>
                                <p>
                                    But if we look at the year 2020, total passenger traffic at MCO decreased by 57%
                                    compared to 2019, with a total of 14 million passengers. The domestic passenger
                                    count decreased by 54%, and the international passenger count decreased by 78%. In
                                    2022 domestic passenger traffic reached the pre pandemic level but international
                                    traffic is still 40% below than the pre pandemic level.

                                    The second plot illustrates the flight numbers at MCO, and it displays a similar
                                    trend to the passenger traffic plot. In 2011, there were around 131000 domestic
                                    flights and 11,000 international flights. These numbers were 144407 and 21638
                                    respectively in 2019. But because of the pandemic in 2020, domestic flight number
                                    went down to only 92732 which is 56% below compare to 2019 flight numbers and
                                    international flights reduced by 75%.

                                    The third plot depicts the revenue passenger miles (RPM) at MCO. RPM is a measure of
                                    how many miles passengers travel on an airline. Throughout time, the RPM for both
                                    domestic and international flights grew, but it sharply decreased in 2020. Like
                                    passenger traffic and flight numbers, domestic RPM surpassed 2019 RPM level in 2022.
                                    International flights RPM, however, is still about 50% below its pre-pandemic level.

                                <p>In conclusion, the Covid-19 pandemic caused a severe impact on the aviation industry,
                                    leading to a significant reduction in revenue streams of air carriers. However,
                                    domestic air travel has fared better than international air travel due to several
                                    reasons. The domestic airline industry is gradually recovering from the effects of
                                    the pandemic, and airline companies are implementing strict health measures to
                                    ensure passenger safety and regain their trust. The visual analysis of the number of
                                    domestic flights operated by selected airline companies in the United States shows
                                    that the domestic airline industry is recovering gradually, and significant progress
                                    has been made in the industry's recovery.</p>
